            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AFter diligent Search for this Book, having by happy accident met with it, and procured it for my use; since I am minded to communicate it to the Curious and Worthy, I shall give you some account of the Authors, and their Work. The Authors are <hi>Kiranus</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocration. Kiranus</hi> was King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to which Crown none but Magicians could be admitted, and of which Kingdom the famous <hi>Zoroastres</hi> the first Magician, was. This work of his had been for many Ages turned out of the <hi>Persian</hi> into the <hi>Syriack, Arabick,</hi> and most Eastern Tongues. <hi>Harpocration,</hi> as the Learned are of opinion, was a <hi>Graecian.</hi> There were several of this Name. One of them wrote a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xicon upon the Ten Greek Orators. <hi>Jacobus Maussacus</hi> published him with Notes and a critical Discourse upon
<pb facs="tcp:106843:3"/> him; where he mentions several <hi>Harpocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and among the rest ours, as the Sequel will prove. He is at a mighty loss about one <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocration,</hi> whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions in his Book <hi>De Corona Militis. Tertullian</hi>'s Words are these; <hi>Liberum, eundem apud</hi> Aegyptios <hi>Osirin,</hi> Harpocration <hi>industriâ hederatum argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatur, quod hederae natura sit cerebrum ab heluco defensare.</hi> In English thus; <hi>Harpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does argue, that</hi> Bacchus, <hi>the same with</hi> Osiris <hi>among the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>is pictured with Ivy on purpose, because it is the nature of Ivy to defend the Brain from Drunkenness.</hi> Now <hi>Maussacus,</hi> after he had confuted the Mistakes of several Commentators upon these words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who would make him to mean <hi>Harpocration</hi> that wrote the <hi>Lexicon,</hi> comes to one Commentator, whom he thinks in the right. These are the Words of <hi>Maussacus.</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Jacobus Pamelius,</hi> the last Commentator up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Tertullian,</hi> has taken another, and a quite new course: For he thinks that <hi>Harpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions, is the same with him, whose Manuscript Book <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is kept in the <hi>Vatican.</hi> And if we relie on his Credit, <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s words may not unfitly be accommodated to that Author, who wrote about the Natural Virtues of things, since it belongs to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophy to teach, that the Ivy is
<pb facs="tcp:106843:3"/> sacred to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> because it defends the Brain from Drunkenness. But I am afraid small heed is to be given to these things, and that <hi>Pamelius</hi> speaks as an Ear rather than as an Eye-witness. For I remember I very carefully perused at <hi>Auspurg</hi> a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of all the Books in the Vatican-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, lent me by <hi>David Heschoelius,</hi> with other Catalogues of Libraries at <hi>Auspurg, Bavaria, Vienna,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s, St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and St. <hi>Laurence</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and I met not with any thing of <hi>Harpocration</hi>'s but the <hi>Lexicon,</hi> neither when I was in the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to compare the Printed <hi>Harpocations</hi> with a Manuscript that was there, could I meet with any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides concerning him, nor could I learn any thing from two <hi>Grecians,</hi> the Father and the Son, who had the care of writing out the Manuscript Books, and who have the Catalogue of that Library by heart. But I would not have <hi>Pamelius</hi> therefore rashly censured, nor his Opinion receded from, because perhaps, he did not, as from himself, affirm, that <hi>Harpocration</hi>'s Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was in the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican;</hi> but he has been told so by some, either whose Memory or Honesty failed them, as by <hi>Simlerus,</hi> who first told him in his <hi>Epitome Bibliothecae Gesnerianae,</hi> that a
<pb facs="tcp:106843:4"/> Book of <hi>Kirani</hi> and <hi>Harpocration</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was in the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> But, till all know more certainly and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Harpocration</hi>'s Book <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is somewhere extant, and till it is tried, whether that Passage be in him, which is cited by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> it is my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the business must hang in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and the Trial (as Lawyers talk) must be put off, till another day. For, to say any thing positively about the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this place, and immediately to vouch it for Truth, would be no man's act who remembers he is a Man: It was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily said by a wise man of old <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Ignorance is in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est share of Mortals,</hi> which though we find consentaneous to Truth in other Cases, yet then most, when we take upon us to open and interpret some Places in the Writings of the Ancients, that are controverted, and not well understood. But the Learned <hi>Puteans,</hi> while this was in the Press, told me, they read in a Catalogue, which their Father had a most compleat one of all the Libraries in <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Harpocration</hi>'s Book <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, written Alphabetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was in the Library of Cardinal St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> which is now fallen to his Brother Cardinal <hi>Farnesius.</hi> Which thing, how far
<pb facs="tcp:106843:4"/> it perswades me, that that Author does not differ much from ours, I need not declare: for the Alphabetical order, which we find he observed, what does it argue, but that he was a Lexicographer, not much unlike ours in his way of writing, though he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the Subject? I wish I could obtain that Treasure, that I might publish it with this of ours, we should not be so much in the Dark about this controverted place in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and it would presently appear whether the Author of these two Books were the same, after which we are so solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citously inquisitive.</q> Now that Treasure which <hi>Maussacus</hi> so much wisht for, I here offer to you: for it is the Book of <hi>Kirani</hi> and <hi>Harpocration,</hi> as <hi>Gesner</hi>'s <hi>Bibliotheca</hi> cites it; and it goes Alphabetically as <hi>Putean</hi> says his <hi>Harpocration</hi> did in the Cardinal's Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And as for the controverted Place in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> consult but the Letter Θ, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. of the first Book, and you may be satisfied, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> quoted no other <hi>Harpocration</hi> but ours. Read on to <hi>pag.</hi> 28. and you have this Passage. <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>That you may be without Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,and for all favour and health;</hi> In the Stone <hi>Thyrsites</hi> engrave the Bird <hi>Thyr,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> holding the Bird, and under the stone enclose the Root of the Herb, (meaning <hi>Ivy</hi>) and wear it, and you will
<pb facs="tcp:106843:5"/> be without Drunkenness, and will have Favour with all men; and moreover you will be without danger in the Palace For this is a divine <hi>Dionysiack,</hi> and weakens the strength of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> For so sayes <hi>Harpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </q> And that learned Father <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayes, <hi>Harpocration argues, that</hi> Bacchus, <hi>the same with</hi> Osiris <hi>among the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured with Ivy on purpose, because it is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ivy to defend the Brain from Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> So that <hi>Harpocration</hi>'s and <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Sense are altogether the same. And this must be the Book which no less a Man than <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> quoted as an Author, and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned Men since him have longed to see, but could not. And <hi>Barthius,</hi> another Learned Critick of his time, giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of some <hi>Greek</hi> Physicians, who were never yet published, strangely extolls <hi>Kirani.</hi> For whereas others only transcribed one from another, and little is to be had from any one of them, that may not be found in <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen; Kirani</hi> has many prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Virtues of things both in Medicine, and other Affairs, contained in the Subjects which he mentions. <hi>Barthius</hi> moreover sayes, he saw this curious Manuscript in the possession of <hi>Henry Ellenberger,</hi> primary Physician to the Court at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> who may very well be reckoned among the greatest Physicians
<pb facs="tcp:106843:5"/> of his Age. <hi>Barthius</hi> would by all means have had it published, being a Book of such infinite value: And the rather because it has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Harpocration</hi> in it, who is so highly and deservedly valued by Learned Men. And he reckons it to be <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Harpocration,</hi> as <hi>Pamelius</hi> before him imagined, and as by comparing the Passages in these two Authors we have already proved. So that it is not only my Opinion, but it is the Conjecture of <hi>Pamelius,</hi> who could not after his most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive Search and Research, meet with <hi>Harpocration;</hi> and it is the clear Judgment of that vastly Learned Man <hi>Barthius,</hi> who saw <hi>Harpocration.</hi> And I the rather mention <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius,</hi> because this Translation is from a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of that very Manuscript which he saw in Dr. <hi>Ellenberger</hi>'s hand. Being thus far satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the Original Authors, our next busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will be to enquire concerning the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators of them. <hi>Barthius</hi> conjectures that the Translation out of the <hi>Agarene,</hi> or <hi>Arabick</hi> Language into the <hi>Greek,</hi> was the Work of a Monk of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the time of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> or <hi>Emanuel Comnenus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Calojo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes;</hi> the Conclusion of whose Life and Empire was foretold them both in two Greek Oracles. The Father's in this; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! i. e. <hi>Oh, how shalt thou become the Food of unlucky Crows!</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:106843:6"/> this <hi>Calojoannes</hi> died somewhere in a place called in Greek <hi>Crows-Nest.</hi> And the Son's in this, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the last Syllable of a Word shall gain thee.</hi> Now (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the last Syllable (and the two last Letters) of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Emperor's Name, signifies Eight and Thirty: And he reigned so many years. Besides, Historians write, how at that time the Greek Nation was mightily addicted to Magick. And so, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, this Greek Interpreter must be well skilled therein. The next Translation out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> was made about three or four hundred years since, by one <hi>Gerardus,</hi> a most excellent Physitian of that time. <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius</hi> sirnames him <hi>Fulginas; Raphael Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranus, Suchonas;</hi> but <hi>Gesner</hi> and the most call him <hi>Cremonensis.</hi>

            <p>This Latin Translation has been quoted by many at the second hand. But I never met with any that saw so much as a Manuscript of it, till <hi>Barthius</hi> (as we told you) saw it in Dr. <hi>Ellenberger</hi>'s Hand, who kept it as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel, and a great Rarity. He had wrote in the Book with his own Hand, <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Book in Manuscript, as a singular Boon, from the most Illustrious Lady, the Lady</hi> ELEONOR, <hi>Landgravess of</hi> Hesse, <hi>descended from the Family of the Dukes of</hi> Wirtemberg, <hi>at</hi> Darmstad, Anno M.DC.IX. This Book
<pb facs="tcp:106843:6"/> had, about an hundred Years before that, been <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n the possession of one <hi>Waltherus de</hi> VIELBEL, <hi>Praepositus S. L.</hi> by whose Donation it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>David Vielbel,</hi> Anno M.D.XXX. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dr. <hi>Ellenberger</hi>'s Death, this Treasure fell to his Son <hi>Christian William Ellenberger,</hi> who being a Soldier, bestowed it upon a Physician, his Acquaintance and Friend. This Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an printed it privately; for neither his own, nor the Printer's, nor the place's Name is printed. But he says, he was forced to leave the University, and to retire into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, by reason of the Plague, of which the Famous <hi>Sennertus</hi> died, and he only took this curious Manuscript with him, and in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement fitted it for the Press. It bears Date M.DC.XXXVIII. So that it seems, but a few Copies were printed, and those private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distributed; one of which with some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I procured.</p>
            <p>As for the Book, it seems to be one of that sort of Books which Men in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who used curious Arts, brought together, and burnt, the Price whereof being counted, was found to be fifty thousand pieces of Silver. But since such miraculous Zeal is ceased, with the rest of Miracles, this piece of Curiosity needs no more undergo Martyrdom, than Christians now need sell all, and live upon a common Stock, as they did in the Fourth of
<pb facs="tcp:106843:7"/> the <hi>Acts,</hi> especially since <hi>Tertullian,</hi> one of the Fathers, quoted it. It contains, I confess, much Curiosity in it; but nothing to endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Christianity, where it is so firmly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled: And if there be something that deserves the Sponge, yet all ought nor therefore to be obliterated; nor must the Child be thrown away with the Bathe. But the time the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors lived in, requires some Grains of Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And those hidden specifick Vertues of things, and strange Methods in curing Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, may atone for the Scraps of Vanity and Superstition that are in the Book. I find, that former impolite Ages, were nevertheless very curious in Affairs of Philosophy, and in that regard surpassed our better cultivated, and more literate Age. I find also, that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was given to our Authors: Insomuch that <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> (who is quite spoiled by unskilful Transcribers) quotes this very Book. For in <hi>Trinum Magicum,</hi> p. 168. there is this Passage, <hi>Magicalis cognitio existit in speculatione rationum, &amp; in speculatione natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, secundum quod antiquis Auctoribus exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navi &amp; percepi, imo &amp; egomet</hi> Albertus, <hi>ut in pluribus veritatem inveni, &amp; veritatem suppono (eo modo) quo ab aliquo ex</hi> CHYRANDIS <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro, &amp; libro</hi> ALCHORAT <hi>(sc. eruere licuit)</hi> Where it is plain enough, that it was first written CYRANIDIS <hi>libro &amp;</hi> ARPOCRATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONIS,
<pb facs="tcp:106843:7"/> and by mistake so miserably depraved. But since <hi>Albertus,</hi> many learned Men of the Moderns have made use of <hi>Kirani,</hi> as <hi>Gesner, Aldrovandus, Balduinus Ronsaeus,</hi> and others. As for Medicines, I know no Specifick men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Ancients, and very few by the Moderns, which he has not, besides many, that are to be met with no where else. But because for some Ages past, to have been a Magician, or a Wise Man, was Capital, it will be necessary to remove some Prejudices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived against Magick or Wisdom, which I think cannot better be done, than by shewing what true Magick or Wisdom is, and how far is is consistent with the Holy Scriptures, which seem most to condemn it. Now, Magick I take to be <hi>a skill which by a certain Power, yet not supernatural, but created, is able to do unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual things, whose Causes are beyond the common Comprehension of Men.</hi> In this Definition we exclude Miracles, as supernaturally wrought by the Finger of GOD. And by excluding from it all Diabolical Contract, we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no other than Magick purely natural, or the Skill of managing Nature by Art, so as to accomplish strange things. We know it was the Ambition of Knowledge that ruined our First Parents; but they had to do in that Affair with the Devil. And I make no doubt, but they had the Knowledge of Good, before
<pb facs="tcp:106843:8"/> they tasted of the Tree of Knowledge<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

For all the Learned hold him to have had an exact Knowledge of the Vertue of things before the Fall. And this Know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge was delivered from Father to Son befor<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> by <hi>Noah</hi>'s oral Tradition, the Post-Diluvi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans were instructed in the same. <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have had skill in Astrology. And the Scriptures testifie, what skill in the Magick of Imagination his Grand-son <hi>Jacob</hi> had, from his pilled Rods, that he set before the Flocks, when they conceived. <hi>Moses</hi> is not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Magician by Heathen Writers, but the Scriptures testifie, how he was learned in all the Wisdom of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> whereo<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Magick was no small Share, as their Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans working Wonder for Wonder with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> a little while, prove.</p>
            <p>We read also of wise Charming in the Psalms, of which sort of Charming we have a Form in this Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 152. And if we should narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquire into all the Books of Scripture, we might perceive, that the Authors of them were skilled in the power of Nature, as well
<pb facs="tcp:106843:8"/> as of Godliness, the former whereof, was, and is called Magick. Nay, the <hi>Magi</hi> of the East, were more devout in following their Star, to worship our Saviour, than all the Nation of the Jews. So that Magick (unless with <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> we use it in opposition against GOD) is not only lawful, but commendable.</p>
            <p>But whereas <hi>Kirani</hi> undertakes to cast out, and drive away evil Spirits by natural Means, this is but what <hi>Tobias</hi> in the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> did by the persuasion of the Angel: For <hi>he remembred the words of</hi> Raphael, <hi>and took coals for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish thereupon, and made a perfume. The which smell when the evil Spirit had smelled, he fled into the utmost parts of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>whom the Angel bound.</hi> The Angel likewise told <hi>Tobias,</hi> that <hi>as for the Gall, anoynt a Man that has Whiteness in his Eyes, and he shall be healed.</hi> And <hi>he took hold of his Father, and sprinkled of the Gall in his Fathers Eyes, saying, be of good hope my Father. And when his Eyes began to prick, he rubbed them; And the Whiteness pilled away from the corners of his Eyes,</hi> and then <hi>he saw his Son.</hi> Now <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rani</hi> so far explains the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> as to tell us the Heart, the Liver and the Gall of what Fish it is, that does these things.</p>
            <p>I remember, I have heard of a Physician, eminent for the cure of Lunaticks, who is said to have used suffumigations or perfumes of
<pb facs="tcp:106843:9"/> something in his Cures. And such you may meet with here.</p>
            <p>You must take notice, that in the first Book in the concatenation of the Vertues o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> things according to the four <hi>Elements,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Plants are analogous to Earth, Fishes to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Birds to Air, and Stones to Fire. For Nature's Interpreters do ascribe miraculou<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Virtues to Gemmus; and without doubt those efficacious and abstruse properties descend from a peculiar influence of the Stars, and a better temperament of the Elements. And is it a great Argument it is so, because in the Eastern Countries, where the Sun is hottest, the best Stones are found. And therefore <hi>Kirani</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes fiery Virtues to Stones, and makes one to be under one Planet, and another under another. But it were endless to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the Rarities herein contained. Therefore with Piety and Wisdom peruse these four Books themselves. The Worth and Rarity whereof, I am afraid, has tempted some dishonest person to rob the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Libraries of them. But are now at length (maugre Envy and ill Will,) communicated to you, for your Benefit, Farewell.</p>

               <hi>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY OF THE</hi> OLD INTERPRETER, <hi>TO THE</hi> Most Prudent Mr. <hi>&amp;c. Ra. Pa.</hi> one of the meanest of the Clergy, <hi>Health.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Admire and commend the Sagacity of Your Prudence, who, tho' You be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in such things as are above the Nature of our Sphere, and have by Contemplation penetrated to things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seventh Heaven; yet you disdain not to look down upon the most inferiour terrene Experiments: For You requested me to translate this Physick Book out of the Greek into the Latine Tongue: a thing much more easily said than done. However, being
<pb facs="tcp:106843:10"/> obliged by your Charity and Bounty to me, I could not disobey your Commands. And because there are, as you know, <hi>divers Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the</hi> Agarene <hi>Tongue into the</hi> Greek, I have industriously and faithfully followed the <hi>Greek</hi> Book that you gave me, in all things. Neither was I willing to pass by the very two Prologues, tho' rugged, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, as it were, from the most ancient Titles: not so much minding the Words, which are of a Barbarian Sterility, as the Sense of Utility. If therefore you find any thing altered, let it not be imputed to my Unfaithfulness or Ill-will, but to common Mistake: <hi>For there is no man so wise, but has some Mark of Folly in him.</hi> Yet I would have you know, that there is among the <hi>Grecians</hi> a certain <hi>Book of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great about the seven Herbs of the seven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> and another that is called <hi>Thessalus his Mystery to</hi> Hermes (that is, <hi>Mercury) of the twelve Herbs attributed to the twelve Signs, and of seven other Herbs by seven other Stars.</hi> Which, if they should happen to come to my hands or to yours, because they imitate a Celestial Dignity, may very well be prefixt to this Work.</p>
            <p>This Book therefore is translated at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, Manuel</hi> being Emperor, <hi>Anno
<pb facs="tcp:106843:10"/> Christi</hi> 1168. <hi>Indictione secundâ. The Book of Physical Virtues, Sympathies, and Cures, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of two Books,</hi> viz. <hi>The Experience of</hi> Kiranides Kirani, <hi>King of the</hi> Persians, <hi>and out of the Book of</hi> Harpocration <hi>the</hi> Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>to his own Daughter.</hi> And the first Book of <hi>Kirani</hi> was thus, and so we will suppose it was the great Gift of the <hi>Agarenes</hi> to him. He that received this Book from GOD, was <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> well known to all men. Do not therefore deliver it to the Ignorant, but keep it to thy self as a great Possession: and let the Father▪ if it may so be, deliver it only to his Children instead of <hi>Gold</hi> for the efficacy of its Action, adjuring them, as sacred Children, only to keep it secret,</p>
            <p>This Book was engraven in <hi>Syriack</hi> Letters upon an Iron Pillar, in a Book indeed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by me formerly. But in this Book which is called <hi>Kiranides, twenty four Stones, twenty four Fishes, twenty four Herbs, and twenty four Birds are written of.</hi> The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of every one of these are complex and intermixt with the rest, for the Cure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Delight of mortal Bodies: And truly the invention or beginning is from Almighty GOD; for by his Wisdom we obtain the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Herbs, Fishes and Birds, and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Stones, and the Nature of Animals and wild Beasts, and moreover, the mutual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtions
<pb facs="tcp:106843:11"/> of them, and their Communities and Proprieties, since the knowledge &amp; skill of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things comes from GOD into men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dividing into three <hi>Kiranides;</hi> I have declared the whole Composure in order of the Alphabet, according as any thing worthy Remarque occurred. And they are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (<hi>Koiranides</hi> or Queens) because these are the Queens of all the rest of my Books. And we found <hi>Kirani</hi> of the King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> which is the first of these Books.</p>
            <p>This indeed is the Prologue of <hi>Harpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and it is thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Therapeutick</hi> (that is, the Curatory) <hi>Book of</hi> Syria, Harpocration <hi>wrote it to his own Daughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When formerly I travelled through the Country of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I found a City, <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi> by Name, the History whereof I have written; but we have no occasion to make any long Discourse upon that City, because we would not alwayes be upon Preambles. Now therefore let us return to our proposed Intention. Then, says he, I saw another City yet, seventeen <hi>Persian</hi> Miles distance from <hi>Seleutica,</hi> which <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; afterwards <hi>Seleutica</hi> was built, under the Dominion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and inhabited by the Nation of the <hi>Persians.</hi> This is called
<pb facs="tcp:106843:11"/> little <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which is near <hi>Babylon.</hi> And this is the History of <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Year it happened, that I found an old man skill'd in Foreign Learning, and in the Greek Tongue: But he said, he was a <hi>Syrian</hi> by Nation, was taken captive, and lived there: and he went round the City with me, and shewed me every thing. And when we came to a certain place about four Miles distance from the City, we saw a Pillar, with a great Tower, which the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Syria</hi> said they brought from the Aedifice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and placed it there for the Health and Cure of the Men of that City. Looking therefore well upon it, I found it was written in strange Letters. The old Man therefore, assoon as he was asked by me, agreed to shew me, and I willingly lent an ear to him, while he discoursed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Barbarous Letters that were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pillar in the Aeolick Tongue. My Son, saith he, You see three Towers stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, one of which is five Miles distant, another two and a half, and another four. These were built by the Giants, who had a mind to climb into Heaven; for this their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Madness some of them were struck with Thunder, others through the just Judgment of GOD, knew not themselves, and the rest were cast into the Isle of <hi>Crete,</hi> into which,
<pb facs="tcp:106843:12"/> God, being angry with them, hurled them. The old Man therefore, who shewed me these things, bade me measure the greatness of the Stone with a Cord: Therefore measuring that which was nigh, I found it two and thirty Cubits high, and seventy nine broad; and there were two hundred and eight steps to it. We also saw a Sacred Cloyster, and in the middle of the Cloyster there was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, having three hundred sixty five Silver Steps, and sixty more of Gold, by which we went up to pray to GOD. And he told me the Mysteries of the Living GOD, which I will not tell to all. I was indeed willing to be informed of other things, and propounded several other things; but my main design was to be informed of the Pillar: And the old Man drawing aside a Silken Veil, shewed strange and foreign Letters engraven upon it. And because he was skilled in my Tongue, I entreated and begged of him, that he would candidly and without Envy make plain all things to me. Now the Things that were read upon the Pillar, were these;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is a manifold Table of the true Example, alwayes having, and knowing, and fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Immissions of the Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Second Book may in the Name of GOD be called <hi>Kirani. The Second Book go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the little</hi> Archaicus Syriacus, as the
<pb facs="tcp:106843:12"/> clear Flood of <hi>Euphrates</hi> runs swiftly. <hi>These Things were engraven on Iron Pillars.</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Both whatever things were formerly, or shall be hereafter, equal Conjunctions of them in Virtues of Stones, and with them also both the Plants of the Earth, and the Fishes of the Deep, and the Fowls of the Air, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Virtue with Virtue in the greater Quaternary: For these things are good for Men that were formerly, and shall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; because being immortal bearing a mortal Body, carried through the Air, bound with the evil Bonds of Necessity; as GOD himself said, governing mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, thou art made in Sin, and encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the sordidness of Necessity, as any one in Fetters, unless he get out, and in Bonds and Chains; so Necessity straitens thee in hard Bonds: But when thou art got out of the dull Body, thou shalt truly see GOD, that rules in the Air and in the Cloud, who causes Thunder and Earthquake, Lightning and Thunder-bolts, and who shakes the Foundations of the Earth, and the Waters of the Sea. These are the Works of GOD the Father Eternal. O Soul! GOD shews these things, and all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this Book was buried in the Fens of <hi>Syria,</hi> engraven upon an Iron Pillar all over
<pb facs="tcp:106843:13"/> Steel or Endanick, as we said before in the former Book, which is called <hi>Archaicus:</hi> But in this, that is called <hi>Kiranides,,</hi> four and twenty Stones, four and twenty Fishes of the Sea, four and twenty Herbs, and four and twenty Birds are written of, The Virtue of every one of these shall be complicate and mixt with the other Virtues, that asswaging and strengthening this mortal Body, we may enjoy Health Eternal: <hi>For none gives Spirit to Man but GOD;</hi> for all things are written according to the Construction of GOD: And this is the Beginning. For tho' the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings or Prologues of each have a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; yet henceforth they begin as it were in Consonance.

A Decoction of the Leaves also, drunk with a little Honey, asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges every Disease of the Neck: And if you add a little of the Stone, that Disease will neither encrease, nor return again. I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106843:14"/> seen several, who have had their Bones crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I admired how they were cured. One can testifie this, who was twenty five years old, and is now restored without pain by this Divine Medicine and Nature: Nor indeed were there any Hands before; all the Flesh was withered upon one, nor had it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sense; but all the Members besides had their feeling. <hi>Also to make broken Bones whole, I found in this Sacred Book thus:</hi> Give the Juice of the Leaves of the Herb, and as much white Wine mixt with it, to drink for seven days. And the Eagle-Stone worn about one, and the Fish eaten, do the same thing. <hi>Keep this Gift of GOD, and give it not to thine own Son! For the Thumbs and incurable Nails:</hi> When the Nail of the Thumb falls, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and is alwayes running, infuse Dates bruised in white Wine, and lay them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on alone, chewed, and sometimes with Oyl of Roses. <hi>For Warts:</hi> And for Warts, which come either all over the Body, or in any Part, burn the Branches or Wood of Vine, and apply the Water that comes out with the Smoak of the Vine-Leaf, or give it to drink, and they will all fall off: <hi>Teach no man this!</hi> So the Dung of an Eagle applied, will cure: The Stone applied, and the Fat of the Fish anointed, does also cure. <hi>For

And this is far greater. <hi>For Putrefaction of the Tongue, and Mortification of the Gums.</hi> But now we tell you something that is great. We saw something marcid and cancerous in the Tongue, which was like also to mortifie the Gums; therefore by applying the Juice of the Leaves mixt with Honey, it was cured; then strewing on dry <hi>Iris,</hi> the Ulcer filled up. <hi>For all Breaches, and a</hi> Polypus, <hi>and Frettings, and Eatings, and Humors, and whatever happens about the Nose, a Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</hi> Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iv.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106843:15"/> ℥vj. Boyl it to half, and give it to wash the Mouth for three or five or seven days, and your Teeth will never ake. If one will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently consider, the Vine will cure all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases from the Head to the Feet. This Herb is called <hi>THEOdorica,</hi> i. e. <hi>Given of GOD. Kiranus</hi> and <hi>Harpocration</hi> do thus far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Kiranus</hi> brings something new, and says, <hi>For Ʋrine and Stool;</hi> The Sprouts, I say, of the first Budding of this Herb, boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eaten, provoke Urine and Stool. But both the Leaves, and the Root, and the Fruit have a very hot and sharp Virtue. <hi>For the King's Evil, and eating Flesh, and putrid Ʋl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Gangrenes.</hi> And it has also another very famous Virtue and Divine Efficacy; for it cures the King's Evil, and putrid Ulcers and Gangrenes, and eating Sores, made up with <hi>Aristolochia</hi> into a Plaster. And its Root rosted, brings a good Colour into the Face, and a tender Skin. <hi>And it takes out Moles, Corns and Freckles;</hi> Mixt with Flower of bitter Vetch and Foenugreek, it takes away Corns, Frec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles and black Moles. And boiled with Oyl till it congeals, it is good for the same. And the Root broken in Wine, takes away Livid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Eyes and Whitlows. <hi>For a Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> It amends any Ulcer of the Genitals, and dissipates and disperses Swellings. <hi>For the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106843:16"/> Epilepsie.</hi> An ounce of it given every day for a Year with <hi>Oxymel,</hi> cures it. <hi>For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy and Swimming in the Head, and Biting of Serpents, and Miscarriage.</hi> It is also good for Apoplectick and Vertiginous Persons: Give ℥ij, and it quickly cures such as are bitten by Serpents; It corrupts the Birth also, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs the Belly and the Sense; and applied, it brings away the Secundine, and drunk, it moves Urine. Eighteen grains of it drunk for thirty days, wastes the Spleen. Made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Plaster with Figs, it is good for the same. It is boyled for hot Insessions for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the <hi>Matrix.</hi> It also moderately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Belly. And its Fruit in an Oyntment and Plaster, is good for the Scurf and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie. The Juice of the Herb drunk in Broth, causes Milk. Drunk and anointed with Oyl, it is good for Epaticks. Its Leaves also in a Cataplasm with Wine, are good for all Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And applied, they are good for Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Swellings. And we may say further, <hi>It is good for all things to him that useth it with Caution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are two sorts of it. The first is called <hi>the white Vine,</hi> which some call Bryony, others Snake-Grape; others <hi>Coelidonia,</hi> others <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, others <hi>Kethedron.</hi> The Buds, and Leaves, and Claspers of this are like the Domestick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106843:16"/> Vine, but they are thicker, and implicated with the adjacent Fruits, catching with their Claspers; and it has a red Grape-like Fruit, wherewith Hides have their Hair fetcht off, or are prepared. And the second sort of it is called the <hi>black Vine,</hi> which they also call Bryony; and some <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, having Leaves like Ivy, but the great ones like Bind-weed, but greater; this also applies it self to, and takes hold of Trees with its Claspers. And its Fruit is like Grapes; they are green in the beginning, and when they are ripe, they are black without, but like Box within. And its Sprouts also at the first budding may be boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like Pot-herbs; and they are diuretick, and force the <hi>Menstrua;</hi> they cure the Spleen. The Roots are very good for Splenetick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the whole Herb is proper for such as are Epileptick and Vertiginous. And its Leaf in a Cataplasm with Wine, is good to eat away proud Flesh, and for wrested and dislocated Limbs, and for Relaxations; and further, it has a Virtue like to the former.</p>
               <p>And the white Vine has other Efficacies secular and delightful, so that being applied, it does not only give any man Sobriety, but causes Delight. <hi>So says</hi> Kiranus <hi>in this place,</hi> After the Dissonance of them both, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Harpocration</hi> his Speech: <hi>O blessed Herb!

O Grape bearing Drink! maist thou loosen the Limbs, cause Sleep! No Speech nor Body shall expel thee; but thou findest out whatever things are in the Minds of Mortals, and what Mysteries they have hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in their Mind. The Vine makes manifest all Secrets, and all things that shall be concealed by Writing, or by Medicine, or by Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by the Sword, or by Science: For these may be said to be the Mysteries of the Vine.</hi> And it has other mundane things also, which are not unprofitable to Mortals, yea, they bring Delight and Joy.

Therefore take the Grape having four Seeds, take out the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels with your Nails, and not with your Mouth, and put them in a course Cloth, and hang them about your Neck, and it will cause Health. And the Stone that is in the Head of the Fish, hung about the Neck, takes away a Quartane. Therefore take the Eagle-Stone, and engrave also an Eagle upon it, and under the Stone put the Kernels of the Grape, and the top of the Feathers of an Eagles wing; and if you have not an Eagle, of an Hawks, and enclosing it, wear it. For it will preserve you from all the foresaid Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of Evil: Moreover it will give you power to speak, and to have friendly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Great Men; and it is good for many other things; all which I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>

Enclose therefore the Stone of the Fish <hi>Cynaedius.</hi> But if you have not one of them which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the head, you must put underneath the Root of the Herb, and the end of the Bird's left wing. Enclose it in a large Gold Box, and you must put it into a thong of the nerve of a Hawk's Stomach, let it be thin, sewing it in the middle of the thong or nerve, that it do not appear. This is that which is paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the head of <hi>Venus,</hi> comprehended in a thong or ligature, which is called <hi>Cestus. That a Male may not erect;</hi> If any one touch a Male with the thong or ligature, he will

And if he carry any of the Stone of the Fish, he will be altogether luxurious, not returning to his Nature. And if a Woman carry this ligature, none will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally lie with her. For the Man cannot erect. And the measure of the ligature in respect of breadth, must be two fingers; of length, five palms. <hi>Another Preparation of</hi> Venus; There is also another Vessel or Preparation of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which the Queens of <hi>Venus</hi> carry in pure Gold, and whoever else are able. These al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so must be in a ligature, which is made of a nerve in such a manner, as that the stones appear not, having a Sculpture, as is subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the first must be <hi>(Lapis Sulphureus) Lechnitis</hi> or <hi>Kerannitis</hi> in the middle of the thong or ligature, having <hi>Mars</hi> armed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven. In this let there be Diamond stones sewed, having <hi>Venus</hi> with a thorn about her feet. And again on the other side two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate winged Creatures, having <hi>Venus</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her hair to Love standing by. Again al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so other two stones on each side, and in like manner a <hi>Sardinian</hi> engraven, having on each side a Sun drawn with four Colts, that is, a Coach, and a Moon with two Bulls, each stone having each: And other two stones on each side, having <hi>Mercury</hi> engraven, with the rod of a Scepter in his right hand: And other

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106843:34"/> dayes, and grow to be as big as Flies, then as Locusts, which being augmented in bigness, become Birds, called Quails. After this the South or South-west Wind blowing strong, they pass the Seas into</hi> Pamphylia <hi>or</hi> Cilicia <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and consequently, the North-wind blowing, they go to the Sea-coasts of the Country of</hi> Syria <hi>and the other parts of the Land of</hi> Melanitis. <hi>But abominable false Sophisters say, they are chast, whereas they know not the Nature of them. Orphos</hi> is an edible Sea-fish, much like a Tench. <hi>Onychites</hi> is a <hi>Sardonyx</hi> stone known to all. The Root therefore of the Herb boyled with Oyl and the Fat of a Quail, and then a little Wax added, <hi>is good for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Matrix, and Swellings, and Ʋlcers, and Itchings, and all other Womens Diseases in the</hi> Matrix. And it is put into Medicines for the Kidneys. And it is good for <hi>Cheironia, i. e.</hi> the King's Evil. The Eyes of a Quail, with the Root of the Herb hung about one, diminish a Quotidian and Quartan cold Fit in the wain of the Moon. <hi>For Illusion;</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Eyes of the Quail or of the Sea-Tench with a little water in a Glass-Vessel for seven dayes, then add a little Oyl: Put a little of this in the Candle, or only anoint a Rag, and light it among the Company, and they will look upon themselves like Devils on fire, so that every one will run his way. In
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106843:35"/> the <hi>Sardonyx</hi> Stone engrave a Quail, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Feet a Sea-Tench, and put a little of the foresaid Confection under the Stone in the hollow of the Ring. And when you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not to be seen, anoint your Face all over with the foresaid Confection, and wear the Ring, and no Man shall see you, if you do any thing in the House; no, not if you should take any thing away that is in the House.</p>

                  <hi>Satyrion</hi> is an Herb like <hi>Spinosa,</hi> and it starts up with its whole Stalk from the Ground; it is two Palms in heighth, full of Seed: It and the Seed have a watrish pale Colour. The Estrich is a known Bird. The Sea-Cow is an edible Fish, well coloured and known. The immaculate Saphire is dedicated to <hi>Venus.</hi> Therefore the Preparation of the Herb is in this manner; <hi>For spent and barren Women, and for Coition, and for such as have a watry and thin seed, and which cannot conceive, and such as are withered and dry: For this is arid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, and gives Conception.</hi> If before Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you strew it on the virile Member, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honey, the Woman will be debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And if the Woman be so anointed, the Intenseness of the Act will be great: For it dries up Nature, and causes Conception, and makes barren Women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.

                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>an Eagle is the King of all Birds, blackish in Colour; when she flies through the Air, every Bird trembles.</hi> And it has great Actions. Take therefore an Eagle, and let her live one Day, and a Night, and take, and gather the Dung that she has made, then tie her Feet, and stop her Mouth, and say in the Eagle's Ear, <hi>O Eagle, Friend of Man, now I kill thee for the Cure of all Infirmity; I conjure thee by the GOD of Heaven and Earth, and by the four Elements, that thou have efficacy for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cure, for which thou shalt be given!</hi> After this, take a Sword all of Iron, suffumigating with <hi>Storax</hi> and Honey; then set a Bowl under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, cut off her Head over the Bowl, that all the Blood may run into the Bowl. And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106843:64"/> by and by, while she is yet sprawling, cut her up, and take out her Heart, and all her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and put them in some Vessel, in which there is odoriferous Wine for drinking: And put up the Head with much Salt: But take out the Eyes and Brain apart: And take all the Inwards out of the Wine, and smyrnizate (or spice) them with Salt, and dry them in the Sun, and take the Blood, and dry it, and put it up in a Vessel. And pull the Eagle, and save the great Feathers of her Thighs. Take therefore the Sinews of her Thighs; Mark which are of the right, and which of the left. So also do with the Feathers which are of the Wings. And make all the Flesh fragrant, smyrnizating it with much Spice, as also the Inwards, and dry them. You must keep them all apart, and write upon them. <hi>For the Head-ach a certain great Miracle;</hi> The Bone of the Crown of the Eagle's Head, tied to the Patient in Deer's Leather, <hi>cures the Crown of the Head.</hi> And an Eagle's Temples <hi>cure a Hemierania.</hi> Also the Brain of it, with a little Oyl &amp; Tar, applied as an oyntment, <hi>cures all swimming and indisposition of the Head. For Favour and Fortune;</hi> its right Eye tied in a clean Cloth, and held in the left Hand, in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with great Men, procures Favor and Friendship. And its right Eye hung about one in Deer's Skin, <hi>will never permit the Bearer to

For Love;</hi> The Kidneys dried, and steeped, and strewed in Sawce, <hi>and given in Drink or Meat, will draw the Party that drinks them, be it Man or Woman, into Concupiscence and great Love.</hi> And a Feather of the right wing held by one, <hi>makes the Bearer rich and amiable.</hi> And if any one
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106843:65"/> hold a Feather of the left wing, and dip it in Oyl, and anoint a Woman in travail from the place grieved to the <hi>Spina sacra, she will be delivered immediately.</hi> And its dry Dung suffumigated, <hi>helps Women in travail, and brings away a dead Child, and extracts the After-burthen,</hi> The Sinews also of its Neck and Back, and the Spondyls of the Neck, tied the right to the right, and the left to the left side, <hi>are good for the Gout.</hi> And in like manner the Sinews of the Legs <hi>cure the Gout in the feet and pain in the knees,</hi> And its Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons carried by Children or old People, <hi>free the Bearer from evil and cruel Phantasms, and from all harm.</hi> And the Skin dressed, and carefully handled, and kept with the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on, applied as a Stomacher to the Belly and Stomach, <hi>cures them excellently well that have the Colick, and a bad Stomack, and the Colick in their Stomach, and it causes digestion; It gives also an Oracle in Sleep, of such things as shall come to pass.</hi> And if any one, when he goes to sleep, lay the Mouth or Bill of an Eagle at his head, <hi>he will see in his Sleep what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleases.</hi> And all those things we have said, are concerning the Eagle. But if you cannot find an Eagle, take a Vultur, and act in the same manner: For it will do the same things, but not so intensely. And the Vultur has its proper Virtues and Efficacies.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106843:66"/> And if you have not a Vultur, a Hawk does the business, but less effectually. Each has its proper Virtues. And the Eagle, being greater than all, can do greater things, and this is its proper Virtue. And if one put the Feather or the Wing of an Eagle under the feet of a Woman in travail, <hi>she will presently be delivered;</hi> but assoon as she is delivered, take away the Feather.

For they know the time afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and all come thither. The Army of the Storks indeed put themselves in Battalia on one side of the River; and the Crows and Vultures, and all the carnivorous Birds tarry on the other side of the River. And they tarry the whole sixth Month for battel. For they know the days whereon they are to engage. And then a Cry is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106843:73"/> heard to the very Heavens, and the shedding of the blood of wounded Birds is seen in the River, and the plucking off of many Feathers, of which the</hi> Lycians <hi>make Feather-beds. And after that the Field is cleared, they find the Crows, and all carniverous Birds torn in pieces. And likewise Storks and Pelicans, and no small number of such as are of their side. For many of the Birds fall down dead in the battel. And this Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, and Victory, on whether side soever it falls, is a Sign to all Men. For if the Army of Storks be Conquerors, there will be Riches, and abundance of Bread-corn, and Fruits on the Earth: but if the Crows get the better, there will be a Multitude of Sheep, and Oxen, and other four-footed beasts.</hi> And the Storks have another certain, excellent natural Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>For when the Parents are grown old, and are not able to fly, their Children, on every side, carry them upon their Wings from place to place, and also maintain them; and if they be blind, their Children feed them; this Retribution, and due Gratitude from Children to Parents, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>

But if you have a mind to make a moist Eye-salve, put it into Honey, without Dross, and use it as an Oyntment. While the Stork is alive, take away the Sinews of her Feet, and Legs, and Wings, and apply them to the <hi>Gout in the Feet, and in the Hands,</hi> joyning like to like, and you will cure them.

               <p>YDROS, <hi>is a Water-snake, living much in the Fields, and frequently swimming upon the Water in Ponds, erecting its breast, a crafty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal.</hi> This has a Stone in its Head, if any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106843:89"/> catch the Serpent alive, he will find the Stone if he charm it, it will vomit up the Stone. Hang up, I say, the Serpent alive, and suffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migate it with Laurel, conjuring it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>By him who created thee, to whom that cloven Tongue of thine does often devoutly pray, if thou wilt give me the stone, I will not hurt thee, yea, I will let thee go home again to thy Friends.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has vomited up the Stone, gather it in a clean silken Mantle, and keep it. The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Stone is tried thus; Fill a brazen Bowl full of Water, and tie the Stone about the Bason, and so you will find the Water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day to decrease two Pints, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Quart. For I once tied this Stone about a Woman <hi>in a Dropsie,</hi> and she was cured: I say, I measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her Belly with a Line, and every day it fell above four Fingers, till her Belly return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into its Compass, and then I took it away: For if I had let the Stone tarry on any longer, I should have dried up even the natural Moisture. The Stone, I say, is proper, carried to a measure: For being carried about one, <hi>it is not only good for a Dropsie, but also it has sympathy with a Defluxion into the Feet, and with a Rheum in the Eyes, and with a rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Head, or any other part; and upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its Nature, it cures them of over much Moisture.</hi>
